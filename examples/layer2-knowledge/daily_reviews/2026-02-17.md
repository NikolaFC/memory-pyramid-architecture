## Achievements

1. **Completed OpenViking research** - Analyzed ByteDance's AI Agent context database methodology
2. **Designed four-layer pyramid architecture** - Night-owl optimized memory system
3. **Fixed 5 cron job model errors** - Updated deprecated model aliases
4. **Created comprehensive documentation** - 15KB workflow guide in docs/guides/
5. **Packaged as reusable skill** - memory-pyramid-architecture skill for community

## Lessons Learned

1. **QMD retrieval is more efficient than file reading** - Saves 30k+ tokens per search
2. **Night-owl boundary at 22:00 preserves creative flow** - Prevents calendar-splitting of deep work sessions
3. **Angel_Core.md is emergency-only** - Normal operation starts from MEMORY.md

## Decisions Made

1. Daily Review scheduled at 22:10 (after last Micro-Sync at 22:00)
2. Separate night logs with `*-last-night.md` naming convention
3. Four distinct layers: Raw → Structured → Knowledge → Navigation
4. Late Hour Sync at 07:00 to capture 22:00-07:00 window

## Automation Candidates

1. **Cron model validation skill** - Prevent future model alias errors
2. **Automatic QMD collection registration** - When adding new memory layers
3. **Daily memory quality checker** - Verify logs are being generated

## Open Questions

1. How to visualize memory pyramid flow for debugging?
2. Should we add sentiment tracking to daily reviews?
3. What's the optimal compression ratio for each layer?
