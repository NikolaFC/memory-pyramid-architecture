## Pattern Analysis

### Repeated Unautomated Work

1. **Manual cron model fixing (3 times)**
   - Pattern: Using deprecated model aliases (moonshot/kimi, moonshot/trinity)
   - Impact: Causes cron job failures
   - Recommendation: Create automated model validation skill

2. **Direct file reading without QMD check (2 times)**
   - Pattern: Using `read` instead of `qmd query`
   - Impact: Wastes 30k+ tokens per search
   - Recommendation: AGENTS.md rule reminder

### Repeated Errors

1. **Misunderstanding Angel_Core.md role**
   - Pattern: Treating Angel_Core as Layer 1
   - Correction: Angel_Core is emergency-only
   - Solution: Updated MEMORY.md architecture diagram

## Automation Opportunities

| Priority | Opportunity | Effort | Impact |
|----------|-------------|--------|--------|
| **P0** | Cron model alias validator | Low | High |
| **P1** | QMD-first search reminder | Low | Medium |
| **P2** | Daily memory quality dashboard | Medium | Medium |
| **P3** | Automatic weekly report generator | Medium | Low |

## Error Patterns

1. **Model alias drift** - Using shorthand aliases that get deprecated
2. **Architecture confusion** - Not understanding layer boundaries
3. **QMD underutilization** - Defaulting to file reads

## Knowledge Gaps

1. OpenViking advanced features (quantization, compression)
2. QMD query syntax (filters, aggregations)
3. Cron job optimization (timing, batching)

## Systematic Upgrade Suggestions

### Skill Upgrade

1. **cron-model-validator** - Pre-flight check for model aliases
2. **qmd-reminder** - Prompt injection for QMD-first search
3. **memory-quality-checker** - Verify all layers generating

### Memory Upgrade

1. Add OpenViking research to `topics/research/` directory
2. Create `topics/qmd-best-practices.md` guide
3. Document cron job reference in `topics/operations/`

### Convention Upgrade

1. Update AGENTS.md with:
   - Model alias whitelist
   - QMD-first search rule
   - Layer retrieval priority
2. Create CONVENTIONS.md section for memory architecture

### Soul Upgrade

1. More proactive pattern recognition (suggest improvements before asked)
2. Better token cost awareness (report savings from optimizations)
3. Deeper understanding of user's work rhythm (adapt to night owl patterns)

## Key Insights

This week focused on **memory architecture optimization**. Major achievement: **Night-owl friendly four-layer pyramid** that preserves creative flow across calendar boundaries.

The architecture is now:
- ✅ Fully automated (6 cron jobs)
- ✅ Token efficient (progressive refinement)
- ✅ Night-owl optimized (22:00-07:00 window)
- ✅ Community ready (packaged as skill)

**Token savings estimate**: ~90% reduction in retrieval costs vs flat RAG approach.
